                  In this strategy, applications are “rehosted” on cloud
                  services with no changes to the applications themselves. Apps
                  that run on virtual machines can be rehosted on Amazon EC2
                  instances. Apps that run on containers such as Docker or
                  Kubernetes can be rehosted on Amazon EKS.

                  In this strategy, applications are “refactored,” which means
                  that they are redesigned to take advantage of the available
                  cloud services, resulting in a new, cloud-native application.
                  Apps may be optimized for performance and cost-reduction.
                  Refactoring may include:

              Strategy 3 – Prolific I/O Storage Accelerator
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              This strategy involves Amazon EC2 and EBS, and it uses a software
              solution that GlobalXperts has developed. This solution is
              designed for workloads with extremely high throughput needs. Such
              workloads would previously have been left on-premises with no
              cost-effective way of being moved to the cloud, and they typically
              would run at extremely high throughputs for short periods of time,
              leading to expensive overprovisioning. Our solution can boost its
              throughput as high as 2 million IOPS, and it can return to a
              baseline throughput to optimize costs.
