                  One of the key advantages of cloud computing is the ability to
                  scale resources according to business needs. Whether it's
                  increasing storage capacity, expanding computing power, or
                  accommodating more users, the cloud offers the flexibility to
                  adjust resources on demand. This scalability ensures that SMBs
                  small businesses can adapt to changing market conditions and
                  handle increased workloads efficiently.

                  Cloud computing can be cost-effective for small businesses due
                  to its pay-as-you-go model. Instead of investing in expensive
                  hardware and software licenses upfront, businesses can pay for
                  cloud services based on their actual usage. This reduces
                  capital expenditures and allows them to allocate their
                  resources more efficiently. Additionally, SMBs businesses can
                  avoid costs related to maintenance, upgrades, and the physical
                  space required for in-house infrastructure.

                  rent virtualized computing resources~~,~~ such as virtual
