            Communication within a corporation is key to continued success.
            FirstCaribbean Bank realized that to communicate as effectively as
            possible, it needed to upgrade its systems. Although they were
            already using a great Cisco product, they needed a high-level design
            upgrade to ensure even more efficient communication and experience.

            GlobalXperts, with a business focus on Advanced Cisco Solutions,
            developed a High-Level Design for an upgrade/installation that
            required changes to the entire product line as a premise-based
            solution. Cisco Meeting Place/Webex was upgraded to CWMS or Webex
            Cloud. GlobalXperts, collaborating with the customer, completed a
            full PPDIO (Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, and Operate) cycle to
            achieve the customer’s end goal.

            GX’s consulting engineer was able to work remotely, coordinating,
            collaborating, and communicating with FirstCaribbean Bank to
            finalize the design. Additionally, a GX engineer traveled to
            Barbados during the first week for the project kickoff, survey
            review, and introduction.

            The high-level design for the implementation of CWMS at First
            Caribbean International Bank was a tremendous success. By generating

            increasing customer satisfaction.
