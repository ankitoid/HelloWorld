        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          GlobalXperts partnered with NEC, a major manufacturer, Cisco Gold
          Partner, and systems integrator with offices in over 50 countries. NEC
          specializes in manufacturing communication equipment and managing IT
          networks for large multinational corporations. One of their clients,
          Amgen, is a pioneer in using living cells to create biologic medicines
          and a global leader in biotech innovation. For this partnership,
          GlobalXperts supported NEC’s systems integration and IT field support
          division to meet their high-profile client requirements.

      {/* Challenge Section */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Challenge</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Despite NEC’s vast international presence, the technical expertise
          required to meet the communication needs of their IT support
          division’s global customers was limited in some locations. Their
          high-profile clients required rapid turnaround, demanding a partner
          that could provide professional services worldwide with minimal notice
          and execute projects swiftly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          For this project, NEC’s end-user client was expanding its real estate
          leasing assets across several countries and needed these properties to
          be operational within three months. This required comprehensive
          wireless LAN site surveys to be performed under strict time
          constraints.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Solution Section */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Solution</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wireless LAN site surveys were conducted inside and outside customer
          buildings using analytic tools to measure radio frequency propagation
          levels and identify existing access points. A spectrum analysis was
          performed to detect RF levels in the 2.4 to 5 GHz spectrum, recording
          data on known and potential interference sources.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          To meet the tight schedule, GlobalXperts deployed two teams across 18
          countries in three weeks, performing wireless LAN site surveys under
          a white-label agreement with NEC. The surveys were completed within
          budget and ahead of the customer’s deadline.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Outcomes</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          The end-user real estate client successfully met their three-month
          occupancy target, ensuring operational readiness for their customers.
          GlobalXperts continues to provide international technical services to
          NEC, reinforcing their partnership and commitment to excellence.
