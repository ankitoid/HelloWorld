          <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
            Arista developed a Layer 2 Leaf-Spine architecture for Entel, a
            major Chilean telecom company, to support their Content Delivery
            Network (CDN) across both main and remote facilities in Chile.
            Arista needed technical resources assistance to provide
            comprehensive professional services, including onsite
            implementation, travel logistics, and remote project scoping and
            review, to ensure the successful deployment of the architecture in
            these diverse locations.
