        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In the early 2000s, the customer had a strong technical team but not
          enough personnel to scale their consulting, systems integration, and
          managed services operations. They required a partner with advanced
          Cisco expertise and a 24x7 Network Operations Center (NOC) to handle
          their rapidly growing client demands.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Solution</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In 2005, GlobalXperts entered into a co-management agreement to
          provide Level 1 remote monitoring support during non-business hours
          and weekends. This allowed the customer to focus their technical
          staff on core IT solutions. Over time, GlobalXperts’ role expanded to
          include Level 2 and Level 3 technical support, covering both on-premises
          and cloud environments. The partnership leveraged shared Network
          Management Software, ensuring seamless hand-offs and real-time
          visibility into trouble tickets.
