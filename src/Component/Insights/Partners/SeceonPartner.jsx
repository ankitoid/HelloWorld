            Seceon® aiSIEM is a powerful complement to Next-Generation Firewalls
            (NGFW) empowering Enterprises and MSSPs to detect and eliminate all
            known and unknown cyber threats in real-time. It uses elastic
            compute power, dynamic threat models, behavioral analytics, advanced
            machine learning (ML), AI with actionable intelligence with
            proprietary feature engineering and anomaly detection algorithms --
            without a need for daily tuning. It provides a zero-trust security
            in the digital era and increases SOC efficiency by over 80% while
            dramatically lowering its operational cost.{" "}

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Cyberthreats have become increasingly powerful and evasive. The
            traditional threat-detection systems of the past may not be
            sufficient anymore. This is why Seceon has used their in-house
            machine learning models to power their Open Threat Management (OTM)
            platform. This ML model inspects vast amounts of data in order to
            better detect threats and provide intelligence. These models are
            updated with continuous learning feedback and decaying outdated
            data, and several detection algorithms may be used.
